# Final Statement

The Delphi specification describes a system for continuously improving an intelligent model of reality.

Knowledge is only one component.

Evaluation, decision-making, research, ontology evolution, federation, and continuous learning are equally important.

The goal of Delphi is not to answer questions.

The goal of Delphi is to continuously improve understanding.
